# Rope And Cloth Simulation üéÆ
The simulation can be found hosted on [this link!](https://ropeandclothsim.netlify.app)
Create your own rope or cloth-like objects and simulate collisions against obstacles, movement in the (user-controlled!) wind and even rope tears. Play around, experiment and don't forget to check out <style>

This interactive simulation uses the principles of *[Verlet Integration](https://www.algorithm-archive.org/contents/verlet_integration/verlet_integration.html)* 
to realistically model rope mechanics and is made using the **p5.js** library. 

*‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, touch controls aren't supported so a mouse/trackpad is needed to use the simulation ‚ö†Ô∏è*
